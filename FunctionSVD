//Footnote 11
//For an embedded timeseries Xt is an element of real numbers to the m+1
//Where the constant term is geven by Xt0==1 
//and the time series value Tp steps forward is Xt +Tp(1) = Yt
//forecasts Yhat = sum overj=0 to m Ct(j)Xt(j)
//for each predictee Xt they used
//singular value decomposition to solve for C
//using the rest of the dataset:
//B=AC
//where Bi = w(||Xi-Xt||)Yi
//Aij = w(||Xi-Xt||)Xi(j)
//w(d) = e^-theta*d/d bar


//looks like need to add Xt0 = 1 to the embedded matrix to allow an independent term, rather than starting the thing at 1
